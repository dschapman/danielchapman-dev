# danielchapman.dev

This is my coding portfolio site. I built it using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) after learning svelte using [Up and running with Svelte 3](https://egghead.io/playlists/getting-started-with-svelte-3-05a8541a) an egghead collection by [Tomasz Łakomy](https://github.com/tlakomy/).

## 🧱 Components

This site has two Svelte components - Projects and Bio. Projects are for different projects that I want to feature on this site and Bio contains some information about me that drops down when the header is clicked. 

## 🎞 Animations

Svelte has great animation support so I used several of their native animations for this project.
